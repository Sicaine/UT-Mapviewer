UT-Mapviewer
============

One of my first java projects. It was used to show in a java applet who is playing online on an Unreal Tournament 2004 Server.

It showed score on the left side and the real time position on the right side.

This Project contains a server(which updates the clients and receive the information from an plugin, running on the Unreal Tournament 2004 Server) and the client.
